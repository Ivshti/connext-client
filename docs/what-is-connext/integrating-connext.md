# Use Cases

V1 of the Connext platform focused on the most simple application of state channels: payments. We see it being applicable as core payments infrastructure for the following use cases:

* Content payments and transactions
  * Video streaming platforms such as Twitch or Youtube
  * In-game microtransactions for videogames
  * Transfers of tokenized advertising impressions 
  * Micropayments and tokenized ratings for posted content on sites such as Reddit
* Peer to peer and machine to machine payments
  * Blockchain versions of P2P payment apps like Venmo or Square
  * Online retailers such as Amazon
  * Tokenized versions of sharing economy marketplaces such as Uber or Airbnb
  * Incentivized mesh networks
* Recurring payments
  * Billing platforms
  * Payroll processors
  * Subscription model companies
* High frequency trading on decentralized exchanges

There are definitely use cases for Connext that we haven't thought of or encountered yet, so if you think this could be valuable for your projects, please reach out to support@connext.network and let us know!

With future versions of Connext, we will move towards a more generalized state channel framework. This will unlock a number of new use cases for channels including games, higher-order computation and more complex conditional payments.
