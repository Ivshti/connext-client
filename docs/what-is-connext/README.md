# Connext Overview

## What is Connext?

Connext is a scaling solution for the Ethereum network, leveraging state channel hubs to power fast and cheap ETH and ERC20 token transactions.

## Which problems does Connext solve?

We believe that decentralized systems have the potential to radically transform applications, assets, and societal functions. To arrive at that point, however, blockchain transaction capacity needs to dramatically improve. We offer solutions to the following issues:

1. **Traditional payment processors like Visa are capable of processing over 50,000 transactions per second \(TPS\); Ethereum averages around 10 TPS.**   With Connext Hubs, there is no theoretical limit to transaction volume or speed; rather, our technology scales with its user volume, and server capacity will dictate maximum throughput.  
2. **Long transaction confirmation times \(15-30 seconds\) hinder UX.**  Transactions via a Connext Hub offer instant finality while preserving the security of the base blockchain. Much like settling a tab at a bar, confirmation times are only incurred when a user closes their "channel" with the Connext Hub.  
3. **High transaction \(gas\) costs limit blockchains' ability to scale.**  Because individual transactions using a Connext Hub occur off-chain, users do not incur transaction fees until they close their "channel" and settle their final balance with the blockchain.

## So what?

IoT transactions, high-frequency trading, content payments, and P2P marketplaces are feasible on Ethereum _now_ with Connext Hubs.
